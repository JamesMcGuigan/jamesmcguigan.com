# Programming Philosophy


I am a javascript architect and data visualization expert with over a decade of industry experience and have full university degrees in both computer science and physics. I can rapidly learn and master new skills. I learnt core javascript when you still had to write your own core infrastructure code from scratch whilst  debugging memory leaks in IE6. Javascript has been my primary language ecosystem for the last 10 years.

My intrinsic motivation is to solve ever more complex and valuable problems; this requires me to remain constantly learning and forever seeking greater mastery over my own skills. I am still learning how to program computers, half a lifetime is not nearly enough time to fully master this beautiful artform.

My computer programming style is very thoughtful. I try to consider the full-project-lifecycle implications of each programming decision and why none of the alternatives was better. A linguistic first development style starts with the question of: “Ideally, how would you like to express this problem's logic and information?”. Good language allows complex concepts to be communicated with minimal human cognitive load. Bad language forces you to think about the language itself; the human average is 7±2 slots of working memory; 7 vs 4 remaining free slots represents a massive exponential decrease in the complexity space of problems that can now be worked with; thus human cognitive load is the most scarce technical resource in all of problem solving. 

I want your most difficult problems.
